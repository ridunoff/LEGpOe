To sort the LEGOs by color and shape we used two cameras and OpenCV to detect and classify the bricks.

The two camera were placed 90 degrees apart from the brick allowing us to see a top and side view. With these readings we could determine the length and width of a brick from any orientation. 


The computer vision portion of this project was made by Anna Griffin
